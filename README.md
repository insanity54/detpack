detpack
=======

Arduino-based wireless theatrical pyrotechnics ignition system

Detpack was designed by DoomSquadAirsoft of Spokane, Washington, USA (www.doomsquadairsoft.com) for use in Mil-Sim Airsoft events. Field tests of our design can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21r4IMiMKF93vCYHH69TBEh6ASPYJjIf

The system consists of Arduino based transmitters and receivers, using XBee modules to facilitate a wireless connection. The receivers are placed throughout the airsoft field in areas were pyrotechnic effects are desired. Up to six theatrical effects may be connected to each receiver. The game admin carries the transmitter on his person, and may queue theatrical events at the time of their choosing.

The system boasts an array of modes, all of which augment the way in which the pyrotecnics are ignited. As of version 1, there is one mode, Firing Scripts. In this mode, a timed script of ignition events are queued. Using this mode, an administrator can simulate an artillery effect in which a prop artillery piece fitted with a detpack receiver simulates a rocket firing, then after 5 seconds, a simulated ground impact takes place 300 feet away.

Future modes include:

* Counter-Strike Bomb Diffusal
* Strafe (simulates ground effects from aircraft strafe run)
